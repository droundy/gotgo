package finalizer(type a)

// This package is nothing more than a more-typesafe version of
// runtime.SetFinalizer.  I don't think it's worth the effort, but
// it's a nice small demo of where we could eliminate some dynamic
// typing in the standard libraries, if we supported generics of this
// sort.

import `runtime`

// The argument x must be a pointer to an object allocated by calling
// new or by taking the address of a composite literal. If this is not
// true, finalizer.Set aborts the program.

func Set(x *a, f func(* a)) {
	runtime.SetFinalizer(x, f)
